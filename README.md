Generates a network with an arbitrary degree distribution, implementing the "Hidden Parameter Model" as explained in Albert-László Barabási's "Network Science". Link to the section: http://networksciencebook.com/chapter/4#generating-networks

I have implemented this for a class homework, therefore it is not optimized mostly because I didn't need to do so. I will update this to fit with NetworkX one of these days.
